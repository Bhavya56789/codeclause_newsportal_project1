                <h3><a href="#">Why Congress has more at stake than BJP in 5 state polls</a></h3>
                <p>The onus is on the Congress to prove that it can still win the three Hindi heartland states 
                    of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which are key to securing power at the Centre

                    Billed as the semifinals before the grand final in 2024, assembly polls in Rajasthan, 
                    Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Mizoram will be held between November 7 and 30. 
                    Political observers view the polls covering 683 assembly and 83 Lok Sabha constituencies as a
                     litmus test for the Narendra Modi-led Union government.
                    However, a deeper look at the contests, taking into account the voting pattern across polls in
                     the past 10 years, shows that it is the Congress rather than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
                      that has more at stake in these assembly elections..</p>

                <p>Wonder who are the biggest shareholders of Indian IT giant Infosys? Not the promoters as in 
                    NR Narayana Murthy, Nandan M Nilekani, SD Shibulal, S Gopalakrishnan, Dinesh Krishnaswamy and
                     their children and spouses; but institutional shareholders? Here are the names of the 13
                      biggest institutional shareholders of Infosys.

                <h3><a href="#">Apple might just launch Pencil 3 with magnetic tip on October 17 instead of new iPads</a></h3>
                <p>It was just recently reported that Apple is gearing up to launch a new set of iPads on October 17,
                     but a fresh leak refutes the claims, saying that the company could just announce its new 
                     third-generation Apple Pencil with a magnetic tip. But, since Apple hasn't confirmed anything yet,
                      there are chances that we may see updated iPad models or a new Apple Pencil. Here is everything we
                       know.</p>
